  <h1 class="content-title">What is Blockchain based Voting?</h1>
  <p class="content">
    Blockchain based voting is a secure, transparent and decentralised way of
    voting. It taps the secure blockchain technology, essentially converting
    ballots into transactions and securely mining blocks out of them. This way
    anyone can monitor votes but at the same time your vote is completely
    anonymous, preserving your identity.
